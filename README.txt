Welcome to Talos Tarot, a project built to mimic the experience of getting your fortune told.
Integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT API allows each random spread of cards to have a unique and engaging fortune, beyond the typical magic 8-ball or fortune cookie. 
The site allows users to get a general fortune told, or have a specific question asked about their future!
There's also the option to view all the cards in one place, for aesthetic appreciation. 



Technologies Used:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Javascript
 - Express 
 - OpenAI API


Future Features:
I plan to add the ability to switch between two decks or more. 
Send the images from the backend to reduce initial bandwidth. 
Have the cards flip to reveal the spread, like real cards instead of just appearing.
